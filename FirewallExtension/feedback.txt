5 extending firewall: works, looks good
5 handling list of firewall rules: write/list works, seems fine
5 concurrency: mutex + semaphore, ok
5 user space program: port should also be checked for < MAX_PORT, sscanf: 300s for path is nice
  (however it should be 299s ;) sscanf is appending \0)

Points: 20
