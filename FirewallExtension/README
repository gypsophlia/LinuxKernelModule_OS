In the firewallSetup.c
    1.There are comments about if to follow a symbolic link
    Because the basic test script added two program of symbolic link
    So if using the follow one, there would be an error
    (the real path of the progran is add into the list in the kernel)
In the firewallExtension.c
    1. The rule list is the struct of below
     -port1---path1
           |--path2
     -port2---path1
           |--path2
            ...
     So the order of path output may be different form the original input
    2. Because the dupliacted rules in the list does not affect the correct running of the firewall   
       They are not considered a syntax error
